                    <p>We believe that playing the piano is first and foremost an act of music making, and making music is ultimately a means of human expression.
                        We wish to empower people on a lifelong journey of musical discovering, opening vibrant worlds of imagination and expression, beyond the popular conception of learning as rote repetition.
                        We offer technologies to support effective, meaningful, and fulfilling learning experiences on the piano rather than false promises of “quick, easy mastery” of musical paint-by-numbers.

                                <p>Inspired by reflections on the lacquered surface of the piano, MirrorFugue augments an acoustic player piano with life-sized projections to evoke the illusion of virtual pianist playing the physically moving keys.

                                <h2>Story</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Six years ago when I was practicing the piano one day, I looked at the reflection of my hands on the surface of the piano and thought wouldn’t it be quite lovely if instead of seeing my own hands, I could see someone else’s hands, and the piano could serve as a portal to someone from far away or even  from another time. Shortly after, I started graduate studies at the MIT Media Lab and started trying to make this idea a reality.
                                    <a href="#" class="expand"> read more</a></p>
                                    <p class="hide">My first term in grad school, I took a music improvisation class with visiting artist Donal Fox, which led to a parallel journey into the art of piano playing, whose insights deeply influenced my work at lab.
                                        I began piano lessons at age 4, and it wasn’t particularly fun. I spent many hours relentlessly programming notes into my fingers, with expression an afterthought to correctness. Motivation largely came from competitions, after which pieces would soon fade from muscle memory, and the whole process would begin again.
                                        It wasn’t particularly fun. Maybe you’ve had a similar experience. Despite the difficulty, many people still wish to learn to play, and there are plenty of tools that claim an easy path to mastery such as light-up keyboards that show you what notes to play, much like paint-by-numbers. In the past few years, I’ve learned that boredom and frustration are not an inevitable part of learning music. I’ve also learned that the paint-by-numbers approach quickly hits a ceiling. The key to music-making is understanding it’s not just about hitting the correct notes but about communication and expression. The key to expression is to always engage the body, both in understanding of technique and channeling of feeling.
                                        My own progress toward deeper musical understanding shaped the development of MirrorFugue. Over several years and iterations, I arrived at the current prototype, which not only presents a useful display of hands and body information but simulates the feeling that the virtual pianist is physically present. On MirrorFugue, we may watch the masters and play with them to absorb elements of their fingering and style. A teacher may demonstrate to a student at a distance. We may also record themselves to evaluate our own progress, even playing a duet with ourselves in the past.
                                        Over the past two years, MirrorFugue has been presented at events such as TEDxBoston and Aspen Ideas Festival, exhibited as art installation in London, Tokyo, and New Orleans, featured on TV, print, and web media. We are now transforming it into a product for the real world.
